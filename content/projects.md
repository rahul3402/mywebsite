here are some of the projects I've worked on:

**Music Popularity Prediction Engine** - Python / TensorFlow : Trained several Convolutional Neural Networks on spectrograms extracted from songs to predict popularity metrics across Youtube and Spotify for songs. Achieved a 26% reduction in total model loss via improved model architecture<br><br>
**Psychic Reader** - Javascript / HTML / CSS : Application for any Google Assistant device that fools friends into thinking the device can read your mind. Launched as one of the first Google Assistant applications<br><br>
**Project Euler Problems** - Python : Programming solutions for the famous Project Euler Problems, which combine Computer Science and Number Theory<br><br>
